# CSCI210 -- William Jessup University
Programming for the ASP.NET and Other Platforms

# Course Description
Introduction to the ASP.NET and Unix-based platforms and web development tools, covering the structures, paradigms, and
problems for which the languages and platforms were designed. Web-based applications implementing real-world projects that
require object-oriented programming and multi-language systems.

This course will focus more on *LAMP* (Linux/Apache/MySQL/pHp-Python-Perl) programming than on ASP.NET given the recent
obsolescence of the ASP.NET platform and the dominance of the LAMP platform.

activities, labs, and projects through the first six weeks of the course. The final exam is cumulative. Of its 150 points,
50 will focus on material, activities, labs, and projects from the first six weeks, and the remaining 100 points will 
focus on material, activities, labs, and projects from the rest of the course through week 14. The final exam will take
place in the room assigned by WJU for this exam at the scheduled time. Additional instructions will be provided in advance
of each exam.

# Grading - Quizzes
Quizzes are independent assignments. They will be administered online. Quizzes are not cumulative, but rather relate 
primarily to material, etc. that has been presented within the prior three weeks of the course.

# Grading - Project
Projects are independent assignments, but some collaboration between students will be allowed. Projects will be scored
entirely based on their functionality, and whether or not the project successfully and efficiently implements the
following requirements:
1. The implementation of a RESTful web-service
2. The response of the web-service to http requests
3. The correctness and consistency of the response
4. The utilization of a database to store web-service data
5. The implementation of a Python web-service client
